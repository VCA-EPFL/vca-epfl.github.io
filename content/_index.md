title = "Verification and Computer Architecture"
+++

**VCA** is a lab at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in the [School of Computer and Communication Sciences](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/).  Our research lies at the intersection between programming languages and computer architecture.  One focus of our research is to work on hardware programming languages to ease hardware verification, leveraging interactive theorem provers to build larger and composable proofs.  Another focus of our research is on building novel hardware architectures to support fine-grained and dynamic parallel computations.
