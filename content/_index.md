title = "Verification and Computer Architecture"

**VCA** is a lab at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in the [School of Computer and Communication Sciences](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/).  Our research lies at the intersection between programming languages and computer architecture.

We are interested in designing high-level hardware programming languages especially to ease hardware verification.  We leverage interactive theorem provers to reason about hardware, leading to more scalable and compositional proofs.

We also focus on building novel hardware architectures to support fine-grained and dynamic parallel computations.

We are actively recruiting PhD students and postdocs. If you are a prospective PhD student interested in this kind of research, please [apply](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-how-to-apply/).
